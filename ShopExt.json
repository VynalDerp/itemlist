Even when they moved out of their free time to work, they were more than happy to do something related to art. Because of their gentle and non-combative character, their society has always maintained a high degree of harmony and stability throughout their long history, with very few conflicts and disputes, and this has resulted in the fact that although they have the gift dexterous in fighting, they are not good at it. \n\nBut all this began to change when the rough outsiders landed on this planet and got a firm foothold: lack of combat experience and training, technology has not been developed to a great extent, the kiiros appear very powerless in the face of foreign enemy attacks, many villages and towns were attacked and fallen, the survival of the kiiros once fell into a crisis, which forced the kiiros to give up their peaceful life, and set out on a difficult and long road of living. \n\nHowever, the invasion of foreign enemies not only spread the war, but also brought the opportunity of technological development to kiiros. With the exposure to the technology brought by the outsiders, the technological level of the kiiros has exploded in a short period of time through introduction and imitation, and the seeds of the industrial age have quietly sprouted within this ancient and backward race......",

Characterized by their pure white wings and the diverse auras that crown their heads, they are often mistaken for angels and have been worshipped by many humans.\n\n      In the distant past, the Milira were strong and warlike. They seemed to be born for battle, relying on their innate combat instincts and superior physical capabilities. They excelled at using swift and fierce close combat, as well as devastating spells to shatter their enemies, thus dominating their realm.\n      \n      However, after vanquishing all their formidable foes, the Milira gradually lost the meaning of battle. The race needed to find a new purpose for existence. But with their exceedingly long lifespans, the Milira's interest in anything could be worn away by the passage of time, leaving only the unfathomable sea of knowledge that continually drew them to explore.\n      \n      Gradually, the Milira ceased to yearn for battle and began to pursue knowledge. They collected languages and texts from various races, observed every corner of the world; built floating cities, and established libraries to store their accumulating wisdom. Over time, the combat skills of the Milira were buried deep in the collective memory, covered by layer upon layer of fertile soil called knowledge.\n      \n      The Milira had a long period of friendly relations with humans and occasionally guided them in the development of science and technology.

The outcome of this war has long been lost to history, but one of its most direct consequences was a series of explosions at a nuclear power plant cluster in Siberia, part of the 'Eurasian Common Defense Agreement Alliance.' The massive energy and radioactive materials released from the explosions accidentally awakened a dormant avatar of an Other god deep within the planet (note: to be verified). The awakening of this Other god resulted in two chain reactions: first, the entire Siberian region and parts of Central Asia transformed into enclosed area, making them inaccessible and unobservable from the outside; second, those who were trapped inside the enclosed area, fortunate enough to have survived the war and the 'awakening,' underwent inhuman mutations. The modern scientific community unanimously agrees that these mutated humans are the original 'cinders.'",
