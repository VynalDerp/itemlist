They collected languages and texts from various races, observed every corner of the world; built floating cities, and established libraries to store their accumulating wisdom. Over time, the combat skills of the Milira were buried deep in the collective memory, covered by layer upon layer of fertile soil called knowledge.\n      \n      The Milira had a long period of friendly relations with humans and occasionally guided them in the development of science and technology.

The outcome of this war has long been lost to history, but one of its most direct consequences was a series of explosions at a nuclear power plant cluster in Siberia, part of the 'Eurasian Common Defense Agreement Alliance.' The massive energy and radioactive materials released from the explosions accidentally awakened a dormant avatar of an Other god deep within the planet (note: to be verified). The awakening of this Other god resulted in two chain reactions: first, the entire Siberian region and parts of Central Asia transformed into enclosed area, making them inaccessible and unobservable from the outside; second, those who were trapped inside the enclosed area, fortunate enough to have survived the war and the 'awakening,' underwent inhuman mutations. The modern scientific community unanimously agrees that these mutated humans are the original 'cinders.'",

Kimiris were made in kurin project of super-soldier creation, kurins are cornered, but they need a foxpower to overcome the existential war and succeed. On one of planets that kurins colonized just a little they found an interesting bipedal, oviparous species, 2~3 metres in height, with a massive tail, they had horns with ability to create powerful electric arcs and ability to navigate by feeling magnetic field of their planet. So kurins took their DNA and created the new species using kurin genetic base, just like they created lilins.",

Their most distinctive features are the lupine ears atop their heads and the fluffy wolf tails at their backs. Today, the entire race lives under the iron rule of a megacorp known as the Military-Industrial Combine—a colossal enterprise that once served as the Wolfein Empire’s defense contractor and has since permeated every stage of Wolfein life, from birth to death.\n\n            Though Wolfein civilization has advanced into the space age, the instinct for rebellion inherited through generations of wolf-blooded genes is steadily being dismantled by the corporate machine. The vast majority of Wolfein now curl beneath the megacorp’s totalitarian rule, their lives dissected into quantifiable data units by an omnipresent, unblinking surveillance system. Even the faintest thought of escape is swiftly erased within the airtight net of control.\n\n            After a brutal total war with the Machinekind decimated the Wolfein population, the megacorp's grip began to show cracks. To fill the void in combat strength, it reverse-engineered Machinekind technology and mass-produced efficient killing machines. Amidst the ruins of war, a resistance movement has begun to grow in the shadows. Bound by the creed “overthrow the megacorp at all costs,” their actions—labeled as acts of terrorism by official media—are now tearing fissures into the rusted iron curtain of corporate control.",
